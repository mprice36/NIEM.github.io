The properties and types displayed in the search results are hyperlinked to display more detailed information about each component. This helps users navigate through the data model to find associated properties and to explore the model hierarchy.

Some additional information about properties and types may be viewed directly from the search results list.  More detailed information will be available by clicking on the property or type link to open the page for that component.

## Search Results Page

### Definitions

There are two ways to view the definition of a property or type from the search results page:

- Hover over a property or type link to see the definition for that component.
- Toggle the **`details`** link to show/hide definition.  Multiple details panels may be open at the same time.

Once the sub-property list is expanded, a **`show inheritance`** link will appear if the type extends another type with sub-properties.
