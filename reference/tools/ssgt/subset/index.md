  title: Generate a NIEM Subset
  short: Subset
  icon: fa-compress
  todo:
  - cardinality
  - nillable, create a page for nillable and see if it's more appropriate to link to that instead
---

In addition to exploring the content of NIEM releases, the SSGT may also be used to build subsets of NIEM releases.  Users may select elements, attributes, and types directly from a list of search results, or from the property and type pages, and add them to the subset list on the left of the page.

{:.example}
> The example below shows an empty subset.  No types, attributes, or elements have been added yet.

![Empty Subset](./images/empty.png)
{:.bordered}

The SSGT will automatically calculate all required dependencies whenever a component is added to the subset list.

- User-selected components will appear in bold font in the subset panel.
- Dependencies will appear in regular font.

If a user later removes a selected component, dependencies that are no longer necessary will also be removed.

{:.note}
> This tool does not have user accounts.  To save your work, you must download a **wantlist** file (a SSGT-generated XML file with a list of user-selected components).  This file can later be uploaded to the SSGT to resume work on the subset.  See below for ways to generate a wantlist.

## Adding Components

### Independently

- Click the **`Add`** button next to the element or type name.
- The component will be added to the appropriate section in the subset list on the left, in bold font to indicate a user-selection.
- Any dependencies the component may have will also be added to the subset list, in regular font.

{:.example}
- In the example below, element **`nc:OrganizationUnit`** is being added to an existing subset that also contains element `nc:OrganizationName`.
- (1) User adds the element to the subset.
- (2) The SSGT adds the selected component to the subset list on the left.
- (3) The SSGT also adds dependencies to the subset list (the type of the element: `nc:OrganizationType`)

### As Sub-Properties

In order to add an element or attribute to a subset as a sub-property of a type, this relationship must be captured explicitly.  The SSGT will not do this automatically.  Many properties belong to more than one type; other times a property may be added to a new type in an exchange.

{:.note}
> Any easy way to tell if a property is going to be added as a sub-property is to look at the `Add` button.  For sub-properties, it also includes a drop-down icon on the right side of the button to allow users to set sub-property options.  Other `Add` buttons do not have this drop-drown.

From search results:

- Click the `+` icon next to a component to expand the list of sub-properties.
- From the sub-property list, click the **`Add`** button next to the property name.
- The property will be added to the appropriate `Elements` or `Attributes` section of the subset list on the left.
- The type, in not already in the subset, will be added to the `Types` section of the subset list on the left.
  - You can click the `+` icon next to the type in the subset list to view all of its sub-properties in the subset.

{:example}
- In the example below, element **`nc:OrganizationLocation`** is being added to the subset as a sub-property of type **`nc:OrganizationType`**.
- (1) User expands the list of sub-properties for type `nc:OrganizationType`.
- (2) User adds element `nc:OrganizationLocation` to the subset as a sub-property of `nc:OrganizationType`.
- (3) The SSGT adds the element to the subset list.
- (4) The SSGT adds the type to the subset list along with its sub-property.

{:.note}
> Adding sub-properties to a type will happen automatically for any property added to a subset from a type page, in the `Contains` section.

### All sub-properties

A user can add all sub-properties of a type.

- Click the `+` icon next to a component to expand the list of sub-properties.
- From the sub-property list, click the **`Add`** button next to **`Add All`** label.  This will appear above the list of sub-properties.
- The property will be added to the appropriate `Elements` or `Attributes` section of the subset list on the left.
- The type, in not already in the subset, will be added to the `Types` section of the subset list on the left.

{:.note}
> This action affects only the designated type.  Any new type added to the subset through this action will be added empty.  Users will need to add individual or all sub-properties to as needed.

{:.example}
- In the example below, all sub-properties of type **`nc:OrganizationType`** are being added to the subset.
- (1) User expands the list of sub-properties for type `nc:OrganizationType`.
- (2) User clicks the `Add` button for `Add All`.
- (3) The SSGT adds the type and all sub-properties to the subset list on the left.
- (4) The SSGT adds the sub-properties to the Elements section of the subset list.

## Modify the subset

### Remove components

Properties and types may be removed from a subset.

- Mark the checkbox next to the appropriate property, type, or sub-property in the subset list on the left.
- Click the **`Delete`** button to remove all of the selections and dependencies from the subset.

![Delete component from subset](./images/delete.png)
{:.bordered}

{:.note}
> If no checkbox is available next to the component, that is because it is a dependency and cannot be removed manually as long as the other component(s) that require it are still in the subset.

### Remove all

An entire subset may be removed.

- Click the **`Clear Subset`** button.

![Clear subset](./images/clear-all.png)
{:.bordered}

## Generate

### Subset schemas

- Click `Generate Documents`.
- Toggle the `Include Documentation?` radio button to either include or remove component definitions.
  - By default, this button will be checked `yes` and definitions will be included.
  - Set this to `no` if needed to minimize the size of the resulting schemas.
- Click the link to `Save Subset Schema to a file` to generate and download a zip file containing the subset schemas.

![Generate Schemas](./images/generate-schemas.png)

This subset will include a wantlist (wantlist.xml) in the zip file so that it can be loaded in the SSGT at a later date to resume work on the subset.

### Wantlist

A wantlist can be generated without the full subset package as a way to save work.

- Click `Generate Documents`.
- Click "Save current wantlist to file".

![Generate Other](./images/generate-other.png)

### Spreadsheet

Generate a spreadsheet representation of the subset:

- Click `Generate Documents`.
- Click "Save current wantlist to file".

## Subset Snippet

The following is a snippet showing the full declaration of type `PersonNameType` from the Core namespace in the 4.0 release:

```xml
  <xs:complexType name="PersonNameType">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>A data type for a combination of names and/or titles by which a person is known.</xs:documentation>
    </xs:annotation>
    <xs:complexContent>
      <xs:extension base="structures:ObjectType">
        <xs:sequence>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonNamePrefixText" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonGivenName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonMiddleName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonSurName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonNameSuffixText" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonMaidenName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonFullName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonNameCategoryAbstract" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonNameSalutationText" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonOfficialGivenName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonPreferredName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonSurNamePrefixText" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonNameAugmentationPoint" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
        </xs:sequence>
        <xs:attribute ref="nc:personNameCommentText" use="optional"/>
      </xs:extension>
    </xs:complexContent>
  </xs:complexType>
```

The following shows a corresponding snippet from a **subset** of Core.

{:.note}
- In this case, only three elements from `nc:PersonNameType` were added to the subset.  Since the other elements in this type are not being used, they do not appear in this subset version of the Core schema.
- The cardinality in this subset has also been tightened from the typically optional and over-inclusive cardinality defined in the release.  In this case, the given name and surname must and may only occur once, while the middle name is optional and may be repeated.

```xml
  <xs:complexType name="PersonNameType">
    <xs:annotation>
      <xs:documentation>A data type for a combination of names and/or titles by which a person is known.</xs:documentation>
    </xs:annotation>
    <xs:complexContent>
      <xs:extension base="structures:ObjectType">
        <xs:sequence>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonGivenName" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonMiddleName" minOccurs="0" maxOccurs="unbounded"/>
          <xs:element ref="nc:PersonSurName" minOccurs="1" maxOccurs="1"/>
        </xs:sequence>
      </xs:extension>
    </xs:complexContent>
  </xs:complexType>
```
