[Movement]({{ site.data.links.movement }}) enables you to search and explore the content of the NIEM model.  It provides a user friendly interface, smarter search results, and a streamlined way to build JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) Schema in support of exchanges.  It is also open source: the community who inspired its creation can contribute to it.
