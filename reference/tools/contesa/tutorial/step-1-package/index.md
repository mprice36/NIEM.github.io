You must package your content so ConTesA can parse the data
and process it against the NIEM NDR automated rules. ConTesA accepts
XML Schema and ZIP archive data.

The three different users of ConTesA (Domain Modeler, IEPD
Developer, and IEPD Implementer) share some common ways of uploading
content to ConTesA. However, those methods might differ depending on
the complexity of the content to be processed.

## Case 1: Single XML Schema

-----------------------------

Let's consider a data model. Your organization has data about traffic
accidents, namely crashes. You'd like to store that data as XML messages
containing a hierarchy of information such that you can name the drivers
and their respective vehicles. You create an XML Schema for the data
model and want to evaluate it against NIEM.

### Preparing for Evaluation

ConTesA can directly accept single XML Schema documents as input. There
are no special requirements to package the content; simply upload
through the ConTesA home page portal.

## Case 2: XML Schema Set

-----------------------------

The previous model you've developed depends heavily on components
defined in other XML Schema documents.

### Preparing for Evaluation

To package your model, place all of the XML Schema documents into
a *.zip archive file. Give the archive a meaningful name (e.g., 
crash_model).

- *ZIP ARCHIVE*
  - *core XML Schema document*
  - *other XML Schema documents*
  - xml_catalog.xml _(optional)_

In the case where the document is an extension of some NIEM subset,
the file structure might take the following form:

- *ZIP ARCHIVE*
  - niem _(usually generated by SSGT)_
  - xml_catalog.xml _(resolves URI references)_
  - *core XML Schema document*

## Case 3: XML Schema Instance

-----------------------------

You'd like to test an instance of the model you've just defined.

### Preparing for Evaluation

To package your model, place all of the XML content into a
 *.zip archive file. Give the archive a meaningful name (e.g., 
 crash_model).

- *ZIP ARCHIVE*
  - *XML Schema instance document*
  - *core XML Schema document*
  - *other XML Schema documents*
  - xml_catalog.xml _(optional)_

In the case where the document is an extension of some NIEM subset,
the file structure might take the following form:

- *ZIP ARCHIVE*
  - extension
    - *core XML Schema document*
  - niem _(usually generated by SSGT)_
  - xml_catalog.xml _(resolves URI references)_
  - *XML Schema instance document*

## Upload to ConTesA

----------------------------

Your model is ready. You've created an instance of your model and now
you need to test is against the automated rules from ConTesA.

Log in to your ConTesA account and click on the **`Upload`** button under
the "Validate a File" section of the home page.

Once your content is uploaded, look for the generated report screen:
