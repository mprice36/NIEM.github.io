The NIEM specification provide the rules and guidance for facilitating development and maintaince of consistent and well-defined information exchanges. The set of specifications can be divided into two groups: Processes and Artifacts. In combination, these groups of specifcations define NIEM-conformance, design, and maintaince.

## Artifact Specifications

The artifact specifications define the normative rules through which individual artifacts are classified as NIEM-conformant.

{:.note}
> An artifact is a NIEM-conformant artifact if and only if it is:
> 
> 1. Has a Conformance Target defined within a NIEM specification
> 2. Adheres to all normative rules applicable to its Conformance Target
> 3. References the namespaces of any NIEM components used within its definition
