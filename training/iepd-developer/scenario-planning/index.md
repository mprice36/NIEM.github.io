In scenario planning, the IEPD stakeholders decide and agree on what will go into the package. This phase can take a long time to accomplish. The more thought and analysis you put into defining your requirements typically results in better schemas and support documents.

## Scenario Planning Meeting

Develop a high level scope and goal of the intended exchange. Decide what information needs to be a part of it. Ask yourself question such as the following:

- What information do you exchange now?
- What information would you like to exchange in the future?
- How would you break these down into discrete information exchanges?
- Who are your exchange partners?
- How are your information exchanges currently specified?

Consider complicating factors:

- jurisdictional boundaries
- privacy concerns
- sharing restrictions
- identity of participants
- technology
- people problems

When you have answers to the preceding questions, you can proceed to the next part, [Analyze Requirements](../analyze-requirements/ "Analyze Requirements").
